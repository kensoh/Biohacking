### Intro
Hi, I'm Ken, and I work in a healthtech startup in London. Starting this page to "build" in the open, if you will, on a personal focus this year - biohacking. I'm turning 44 this year and would like to boost my mental dexterity and physical energy levels above their current limits.

### How
Every 2 weeks, I'll write a LinkedIn post about a protocol item to share more on it, at the same time asking for feedback from my network on tips they have on optimising health. This will let me get inputs in the first half of 2025 and have a good runway to experiment on myself for the second half of 2025.

### Protocol
What|Why|How
:--|:---|:--
Methylene Blue|improve cognitive function|pharma grade, take with water
Echinacea|improve mental clarity|tincture, take with water
Coriander + Chlorella|remove heavy metals|blend together with oat milk
Distilled Water|reduce contaminants|use distiller at home
Fasting (no food)|aid detox process|still figuring rhythm
Caster Oil (topical)|aid detox process|apply on forehead at night
Grounding (natural)|remove excess charges|hold tree leaves or grass
Avoid Coffee|avoid crashes|only decaf coffee, and tea
Avoid Alcohol|avoid hangovers|only non-alcoholic drinks
Avoid Gluten|reduce brain fog|eg bread, noodles, pizza
Avoid Dairy|reduce brain fog|eg milk, cheese, pastries
Avoid Sugar|reduce brain fog|eg added in drinks and food

### Why
Back in 2023 I read this book [Serve To Win](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Serve-Win-Gluten-free-Physical-Excellence/dp/0552170534) by Novak Djokovic, world's #1 in tennis. In his book, he outlined how dietary and nutritional changes led to outsized impact on his performance on the court. Prior to doing things like avoiding gluten, dairy, and eating a plant-based diet, he just couldn't get to the top of the pack. But in the 18 months after he made those changes totally unrelated to tennis training, he rose up and has stayed there for many many years. At 36 years old, he is still outperforming younger opponents at the prime of their lives.

I'm not new to the idea that the food and nutrition we eat impact our well-being and performance. However, this was the first time I could deeply relate to someone sharing his experience on the topic. This was because despite having a highly successful career in tech, I'm even more accomplished in my financial markets skills. Over the past few years I have been outperforming most hedge funds, and their teams of highly paid specialists. With my personal investment portfolio hitting +26.4% gain in 2024, and +11.3% high in the first couple of weeks in 2025. Not to mention 21/22 winning positions in 2023, across stocks, indices, commodities, crypto, forex.

I see the financial markets as an ultra-competitive field, no different from professional sports. To win, an investor or trader will need to optimise everything they can, because once we step into the market, we are competing with the best in the world - the hedge funds, the investment banks, the full-time traders etc. When 2 equally skilled traders meet in the market and one has slightly lesser mental clarity or some unresolved emotional baggage, that trader will lose. It is as simple as that. Novak's book showed a real example of how tennis performance could be optimised outside of the courts and gym. His story gave me the push I needed to take this idea seriously.

I could relate with Novak's intense desire to do what it takes to be the best in his ultra-competitive field.

Fast forward to 2025, I'm eating a mainly plant-based diet but I'm still experimenting, having a meal containing meat or fish once a week. I only drink decaf coffee now and don't drink alcohol. I'm willing to go to extreme measures to do what it takes to win in the financial markets, just like in professional sports there are very few winners at the top who are willing to do and can do what others won't.

Lastly, I know that by optimising my mental dexterity and physical energy, I'll perform better at my startup job (more so when I'm the oldest in the company and 15 years older than the team's average age). Most importantly, I really really want to do well in my parenting role! I started my family late and need every ounce of energy I can draw, and all the mental alertness after work to match my little one.
