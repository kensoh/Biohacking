### Intro
Hi, I'm Ken, and I work in a healthtech startup in London. Starting this page to "build" in the open, if you will, on a personal focus this year - biohacking. I'm turning 44 this year and would like to boost my mental dexterity and physical energy levels above their present limits. Let's go!

### How
Every 2 weeks, I'll write a LinkedIn post about a protocol item to share more on it, at the same time asking for feedback from my network on tips they have on optimising health. This will let me get inputs in the first half of 2025 and have a good runway to experiment on myself for the second half of 2025.

### Protocol
What|Why|How
:--|:---|:--
Methylene Blue|improve cognitive function|pharma grade, take with water
Echinacea|improve mental clarity|tincture form, take with water
Coriander + Chlorella|remove heavy metals|blend together with oat milk
Distilled Water|reduce contaminants|use distiller at home
Fasting (no food)|aid detox process|5-day fast as needed
Caster Oil (topical)|aid detox process|apply just below chest
Grounding (natural)|remove excess charges|hold tree leaves or grass
Oxygenating|maintain alkaline state|through breathwork
Meditation|remove baggages|let thoughts drift
Cold shower|aid blood circulation|ice water in winter
Avoid Caffeine|avoid crashes and lead|not even decaf coffee, no tea
Avoid Alcohol|avoid hangovers|only non-alcoholic drinks
Avoid Gluten|reduce brain fog|eg bread, noodles, pizza
Avoid Dairy|reduce brain fog|eg milk, cheese, pastries
Avoid Sugar|reduce brain fog|eg in drinks and food

### Backlog
Trusted crowd-sourced ideas for selection and experimentation

What|Why|How
:--|:---|:--
Lion's Mane|aid neural plasticity|mushroom powder
Trampolining|aid lymphatic system|jump on trampoline
Milk Thistle|protect liver & brain|tea or powder form
Avoid Seed Oils|reduce inflammation|eg oil used in food

### Why
Back in 2023 I read this book [Serve To Win by Novak Djokovic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Serve-Win-Gluten-free-Physical-Excellence/dp/0552170534), world's #1 in tennis. In his book, he outlined how dietary and nutritional changes led to outsized impact on his performance on the court. Prior to doing things like avoiding gluten, dairy, and eating a plant-based diet, he just couldn't get to top of the pack despite pushing hard.

But in the 18 months after he made those changes totally unrelated to tennis training, he rose up and has stayed there for many many years. At 36, he is still [outperforming younger opponents](https://ausopen.com/video-player#!?videoId=6367445567112) at the prime of their lives.

I'm not new to the idea that the food and nutrition we eat impact our well-being and performance. However, this was the first time I could deeply relate to someone sharing his experience on the topic. This was because despite having a highly successful career in digital tech, I'm equally accomplished in my financial markets skills.

Over the past few years I have been outperforming most hedge funds, and their teams of highly paid specialists. With my personal investment portfolio hitting +26.4% gain in 2024, and +11.3% high in the first couple of weeks in 2025. Not to mention 21/22 winning positions in 2023, across stocks, indices, commodities, crypto, forex. And a positive return in 2022 while the return for hedge fund asset class was negative and NASDAQ was down 33%.

Being a retail investor and trader for 18 years, I see the financial markets as an ultra-competitive field. It's the same as professional sports. To win, an investor or trader will need to optimise everything they can, because once we step into the market, we are competing with the best in the world - the hedge funds, the investment banks, the full-time traders etc. When 2 equally skilled traders meet in the market and one has slightly lesser mental clarity or some unresolved emotional baggage, that trader will lose. It's as simple as that.

Novak's book showed a real example of how tennis performance could be optimised outside of the courts and gym. His success story in an ultra-competitive field gave me the push I needed to take this idea seriously.

Fast forward to 2025, I'm eating a mainly plant-based diet but I'm still experimenting, having a meal containing meat or fish once a week. I know that by optimising my mental dexterity and physical energy, I'll perform better at my startup job. More so when I'm 15 years older than the team's average age ðŸ˜…
