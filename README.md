### Intro
Hi, I'm Ken, and I work in a healthtech startup in London. Starting this page to "build" in the open, if you will, on a personal focus this year - biohacking. I'm turning 44 this year and would like to boost my mental dexterity and physical energy levels beyond their present limits. Let's go 2025!

### How
Every 2 weeks, I'll write a LinkedIn post about a protocol item to share more on it, at the same time asking for feedback from my network on tips they have on optimising health. This will let me get inputs in the first half of the year and have a good runway to experiment on myself in the second half.

### Protocol

### Why
Back in 2023 I read this book [Serve To Win by Novak Djokovic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Serve-Win-Gluten-free-Physical-Excellence/dp/0552170534), world's #1 in tennis. In his book, he outlined how dietary and nutritional changes led to outsized impact on his performance on the court. Prior to doing things like avoiding gluten, dairy, eating a plant-based diet, he just couldn't get to top of the pack despite pushing hard.

But in the 18 months after he made those changes totally unrelated to tennis training, he rose up and has stayed there for many many years. At 36, he is still [outperforming younger opponents](https://ausopen.com/video-player#!?videoId=6367445567112) at the prime of their lives.

I'm not new to the idea that the food and nutrition we eat impact our well-being and performance. However, this was the first time I could deeply relate to someone sharing his experience on the topic. That's because despite having a very successful career in digital technologies, I'm a [seasoned player in the financial markets](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kensoh_pleased-to-share-a-significant-milestone-activity-7291616831981694978-kQHZ).

Being a retail investor and trader for 18 years, I see the financial markets as an ultra-competitive field. Just like professional sports. To win, an investor or trader will need to optimise every thing they can. Once we step into the market, we are competing with the best in the world - the hedge funds, the investment banks, the full-time traders etc. When 2 equally experienced traders meet in the market and one has slightly lesser mental clarity or some unresolved emotional baggage, that trader will lose. It's that simple.

Novak's book showed a real example of how a tennis pro's performance could be optimised outside of the courts and gym. His success story in an ultra-competitive field gave me the push I needed to take this idea seriously.

Fast forward to 2025, I'm eating a mainly plant-based diet but am still experimenting, having meat or fish once a week. I know that by levelling up my mental dexterity and physical energy, I'll perform better in my startup job. Both of which are needed when I'm 15 years older than the team's average age ðŸ˜…
