### Intro
Hi, I'm Ken, and I work in a healthtech startup in London. Starting this page to "build" in the open, if you will, on a personal focus this year - biohacking. I'm turning 44 this year and would like to boost my mental dexterity and physical energy levels above their present limits.

Since the differences between our DNA are very minimal, as I move along this journey, gathering inputs and iterating, my anedoctal experience might be a useful reference for other folks who wish to unlock more out of their lives and maximise their potential.

### Why
Back in 2023 I read this book [Serve To Win](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Serve-Win-Gluten-free-Physical-Excellence/dp/0552170534) by Novak Djokovic, world's #1 in tennis. In his book, he outlined how dietary and nutritional changes led to outsized impact on his performance on the court. Prior to doing things like avoiding gluten, dairy, and eating a plant-based diet, he just couldn't get to the top of the pack. But in the 18 months after he made those changes unrelated to tennis training, he rose up and has stayed there for many many years. At 36 years old, he is still outperforming younger opponents at the prime of their lives.

I'm not new to the idea that the food and nutrition we eat impact our well-being and performance. However, this was the first time I could deeply relate to someone sharing his experience on the topic. This was because despite me having a highly successful career in tech, I'm equally if not even sharper in my financial markets skills. For example, over the past few years I have been outperforming most hedge funds, with my personal investment portfolio hitting +26.4% gain in 2024 and +11.3% high in the first couple of weeks in 2025. Not to mention 21/22 winning positions in 2023, across stocks, indices, commodities, crypto, forex.

I see the financial markets as an ultra-competitive field, no different from professional sports. To win, an investor or trader will need to optimise everything they can, because once we step into the market, we are competing with the best in the world - the hedge funds, the investment banks, the full-time traders etc. When 2 equally skilled traders meet in the market and one has slightly lesser mental clarity or some unresolved emotional baggage, that trader will lose. It is as simple as that. Novak's book showed a real example of how tennis performance could be optimised outside of the courts. His story gave me the push I needed to take this idea seriously.

I could relate with Novak's intense desire to do what it takes to be the best in his ultra-competitive field.

Do you know his reward after winning a major tournament? It was a square, out of a bar of chocolate.

Fast forward to 2025, I'm eating a mainly plant-based diet but I'm still experimenting, having a meal containing meat or fish once a week. I only drink decaf coffee now and don't drink alcohol. I'm willing to go to extreme measures to do what it takes to win in the financial markets, just like in professional sports there are very few winners at the top who are willing to do and can do what others won't.

I know that by optimising my mental dexterity and physical energy, I will do even better at my startup job (more so when I'm the oldest in the company and 15 years older than my team's average age). Most importantly, I really really want to do well in my parenting role! Given that I started my family late, I need every ounce of energy I can draw, and the mental alertness after work to match my little one.

### How
Every 2 weeks, I'll write a LinkedIn post on a protocol item to share more about it, at the same time asking for feedback from my network on tips they have on optimising health. This will let me get inputs in the first half of 2025 and have a good runway to experiment on myself for the second half of 2025.

Before sharing my findings and conclusion for myself at end of the year. For a start, below is my present protocol. I'm not new to most of these, other than Methylene Blue which is in experimental stage. I heard it from Joe Rogan's show with Mel Gibson last week, and decided that I have to test it for myself.

### Protocol
What|Why|How
:--|:---|:--
Methylene Blue|improve cognitive function|pharma grade, take with water
Vitamin B Complex|improve energy level|liquid vitamin form, take directly
Coriander + Chlorella|remove heavy metals|blend together with oat milk
Caster Oil (topical)|aid detox process|apply on forehead at night
Omega-3 (vegan type)|nourish brain function|soft jellies, chewable directly
Grounding (natural)|remove excess charges|touch tree leaves or grass
Avoid Coffee|regulate energy better|only decaf coffee and tea
Avoid Alcohol|avoid hangovers|only non-alcoholic drinks
